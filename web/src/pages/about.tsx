              <p>Milla and Christian met during the summer of 2012.</p>
              <p>
                Three weeks later Milla (6/2 Manifestor) initiated a very
                spontaneous proposal. The invitation was clear as a bell for
                Christian (4/6 Projector). One year later, almost to the day,
                they got married.
              </p>
              <p>
                A year later they were graced with their eldest daughter Leia
                (5/1 Manifesting Generator) and four years after that Elektra
                (6/2 Generator) entered the world. They currently live north of
                Stockholm and are raising their children according to their
                design.

                her experiment. Since 2015 she is also a certified Living Your
                Design Guide and sheâ€™s currently enrolled at IHDS to become a

                As a Manifestor she has a particular passion when it comes to
                helping both Manifestors understand how they can live more
                naturally aligned to their own nature and working with the other
                types to help them understand how to best deal with Manifestors
                in their life.
